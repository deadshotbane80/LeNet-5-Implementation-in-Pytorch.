This project implements the [LeNet-5](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch, training it on the classic MNIST handwritten digit recognition dataset.

I also wrote a [blog](https://vedantpoduval.hashnode.dev/from-pixels-to-predictions-a-lenet-5-intro-in-pytorch) to give a detailed explanation of the whole code.

The architecture of the model is simialar to original [paper](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf) but instead of the tanh activation it uses ReLU and also the weights are initialised using [kaiming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852) initialisation.

The overall accuracy I achieved was 97.4% while running for 10 epochs.
